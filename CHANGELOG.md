## [2.1.0]
- Massive refactoring of internal system from the ground up (faster + more stable)
- Fix typo on editor bar
- Always use cargo, and ignore xargo (previously caused problems)
- Basic filters in output to link to file positions!
- Allow installation of binaries from non-Cargo projects (restriction gone)
- Custom manual run configurations (for advanced usage - set env vars, backtrace mode, and more)
- Improved handling to correctly remove those "this file isn't part of cargo" editor notifications
